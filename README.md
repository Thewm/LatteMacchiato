### My 8 Favorites VSCode Extensions For Web Developers
   
***
It has always been hard for us to choose the best and the best for us. *I am a man too!*     
In the first days of developing, the choice of **helpful** and **advantageous** tools for me was a ~~nightmare~~ and took a lot of time and energy from me. Why should your time and energy be taken too ??!!!     
**Im here to help you 😁**       
It was then decided that in the **exhaustive** and **complete** repository, I was able to introduce **8** useful tools for the developers in *VS Code Editor* .

> Yes, you guessed right!! The name of this repository has nothing to do with its content, and only the author's interest in Latte Machiatto has given the name to this name :)))
